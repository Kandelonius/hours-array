# hours-array
Calculates employee hours

Assignment criteria:

Declare an integer array (named “Hours”) to store the hours worked by our office’s   10 employees. The hours will be entered by the user from the keyboard.  Hours entered should be from 1 to 40 and will be integers; no other values allowed in the array. The names of the employees will not be entered, just hours.
You declare your own array; I will talk about this in class. You will NOT use the args[] array described in JIES.
The program should do just 5 things:
•	Let the user enter the data (the number of hours). Prompt the user for the hours of each of the employees one at a time. Store these in the array.
•	Print out the individual hours in the array after all of the 10 “hours” have been entered into the array. 
•	Print the total hours worked by the employees after all of the 10 “hours” have been entered into the array.
•	Print the average number of hours worked after all of the 10 “hours” have been entered into the array.
•	Print a little heading for the “Hours Worked Report”; label the total hours worked and the average hours worked.
I will put a sample session on our site, probably by Friday evening.
Remember: All the data must be stored in the one Hours array -- not 10 separate integer variables.  Everything in your program revolves around that one array; that is where the data is stored.
The only other variables you should use (unless I tell you otherwise) are:
•	a variable to store the sum of all the hours 
•	a variable to hold the average hours for an employee 
•	Loop control variable(s) needed
(I am aware that you can do this in a println() )  Please declare a variable to store the sum and a variable to store the average.
You can also use a constant NUMBER_OF_EMPLOYEES that will be = 10
Please ask me questions in class if you have any.
